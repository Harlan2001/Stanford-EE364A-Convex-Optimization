# CVX101 - Convex Optimization HW with python

Professor Stephen Boyd, who has written the Convex Optimization textbook, has been adopted by many prestigious universities.In addition, the research team also specially developed a programming framework for solving common convex optimization problems, which supports mainstream programming languages such as Python and Julia. The course assignments also adopt this programming framework to solve convex optimization problems in real life.

In practical application, you will deeply realize that for the same problem, a small change in the modeling process, its equation solving difficulty will be very different, how to make your modeling equation is "convex", is an art.
